\chapter{Preface}

This book is my latest attempt at writing a grammar of Ayeri, a fictional
language (or \emph{conlang}) which I have been developing since December
2003. Getting to work on grammar writing again was triggered in the summer of
2016 by a growing dissatisfaction with not having a central place of
documentation when the first thing people were looking for on my website was
often the previous iteration of the \emph{Ayeri Grammar}, incomplete as well as
partially inaccurate and outdated as it may have been at that point.

This book is not merely a filling-in of blanks in previous documentation,
though, but was written from scratch for the most part. This goes especially
for the syntax chapter, which finally gave me an opportunity to begin
acquainting myself with this field. With this book, you are holding the result
of two years of hard work in your hands. I hope you will have as much joy
reading it as I had researching it.
