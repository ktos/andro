\tandro{Kiiway!}{Welcome!} I am very glad you are reading this book. My name is
Koolder mal Erlehirni and this book is the beautiful fruit of my hard work
started over five years ago.

In the beginning, we started preparing a simple Andro-English dictionary, with
only a few grammar notes for understanding the overall concept of the language,
however during that time a small number of notes expanded into large library.

I have prepared this text, similarly to the Andro-English dictionary, with you -
citizens of the Earth - in mind. So apart from notes about our language, there
will be notes about our culture.

Some of parts of this book may require some knowledge of linguistic terms.

\section{Conventions}

\subsection{Romanization}

While Andro as a language is using different writing systems, on which you may
read more in Appendix A, in this book the romanization system called
\textit{Ziri} will be used.

\subsection{Glossing}
