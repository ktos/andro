# Andro

"Andro" is a fictional language (constructed language, aka conlang), created for
fun and as a part of my worldbuilding initiative, eventually for the book I am
writing since forever and probably will write for a bit even longer.

This repository is a documentation of a language, its concepts, dictionary and
more.

Interactive HTML dictionary is available at <https://andro.ktos.dev>.

## Disclaimer

Everything in here is work of pure fiction. Andro is not related to any
naturally existing languages, living or dead. No real-world languages have been
used specifically as sources of vocabulary or used a base for deriving a
sound-changed daughter language, but you may encounter some English, Polish,
Latin or Japanese inspirations.

All mentions of Earth, And́royas, Maŕid and other places, people and history
make sense only in-universe.

I have no formal education in linguistics and doing this mostly for fun.

## License

Everything in here is licensed under CC-BY-SA 4.0. If you would like to use
Andro in any of your own creations, feel free to do that, but please attribute
myself and possibly this repository. Game, book, movie? Absolutely no problem,
it would be amazing to see Andro anywhere, but remember that many of it make
sense only including the culture of its speakers.

## The Language

Andro is spoken in the country of And́royas on planet Maŕid, many light years
from Earth.

It is a very strange language, partially constructed, based on a pidgin created
from two language families hundreds of years ago, and since then evolving like
any other natural language.

It is theoreticaly tring to be analytic and isolating, but yet there is a lot
of inflection, and on the other hand -- lot of particles marking many things
like case, tense or aspect.

### Lord's Prayer (in older, more formal, Andro)

```
Arśit niyi, chui ari in esi,
epil Nom vage hallo͞i,
epil Kyigerid vage iéni,
epil Bucho vage esi,
in ari, e in maŕida.
Epié dari noni hetay zogie niyi vidal,
e niyi kayetos sichemi hemi,
koe noni niyi kayetoros relita sichemi.
E epié getumi tedima permi no,
abe chu noni o kayri zimebi hemi,
[Imin epil Kyigerid, Rigeypa e Halloya Relita esi]
Amen.
```

## Structure of this repository

The repository is based on the file `dictionary.csv`, which is **not a real CSV
file** - it is actually variable-column-number, pipe-separated text file
covering all words currently existing in Andro. Using that file you can generate
everything, most importantly - the book "Small Andro-Polish Dictionary" ("The
Book"), a fictional dictionary created by a scientist *Koolder mal Erlehirni*.

* `generate-tex-dictionary.py` will parse `dictionary.csv` and create `ap.tex`
  and `pa.tex` and the `small-andro-polish-dictionary` folder, which are being
  combined inside `main.tex` into The Book in Polish,
* `generate-wordlist.py` will parse `dictionary.csv` and generate list of all
  possible words `words-all.txt`, nad `words-basic.txt`, with all basic forms of
  words, in the `final/` subdirectory,
* `generate-md.py` parses dictionary file and creates `final/tables.md` file
  with tables for nouns, verbs, adjectives and so on,
* `generate-html-dictionary.py` parses dictionary file and creates `final/html/`
  folder with interactive Andro-Polish and Andro-English dictionaries as a HTML
  page with search and more -- see <https://andro.ktos.dev>,
* `random-words.py` will generate some words according to the language
  phonotactic rules,
* `check-words.py` will check if all words in `dictionary.csv` are correctly
  built against phonotactic rules.

When `ap.tex` and `pa.tex` are ready, you may compile `main.tex` using XeLaTeX
to get final version of The Book in PDF.

### Structure of dictionary.csv

`dictionary.csv` is CSV-like, pipe (`|`) separated file with variable column
length. It's structure is always:

* word,
* IPA of the word,
* word type (noun, adjective, etc.) as a shortcut: n, adj, v, part,
* undefined number of other columns.

In other columns if the columns starts with:

* `pl:`, it is treated as plural version of the noun, it should has a form of
  `pl:word IPA` (space separated),
* `pst:`, it is treated as past version of the vern, it should has a form of
  `pst:word IPA` (space separated),
* `fem:`, it is treated as female grammatical gender version of the noun, it
  should has a form of `fem:word IPA` (space separated),
* `comp:`, it is treated as comparative version of the adjective, it should has
  a form of `comp:word IPA` (space separated),
* `supl:`, it is treated as superlative version of the adjective, it should has
  a form of `comp:word IPA` (space separated),
* `red:`, it is marking redirection to another word, e.g. `red:anotherword`,
  every else field is ignored in case of redirect,
* `en:`, it is description in English,
* `ennote:`, it is note in English,
* `example:`, is is an example usage in Polish,
* `enexample:`, it is an example usage in English,
* `note:`, it is a note in Polish,
* `src:`, it is a "source" of a word, e.g. Pra-Indo-European (PIE),
* if the column is only `fem`, it marks noun as having only female grammatical
  gender,
* in other cases, it is treated as description in Polish.

Apart from `note:`, `ennote:`, `example:` and `enexample:`, fields (columns)
should occur only once and if they are duplicated, later overrides earlier.

In descriptions and notes, pseudo-HTML may be used:

* `<see>word</see>` marks there should be a link to another word in the
  dictionary,
* `<phrase>some phrase</phrase>` marks some phrase, should be marked
  appropiately in dictionary or can be used to generate some idioms list,
* `<alt>alternativeword</alt>` marks alternative version of the defined word, for example older or dialect-specific,
* `<em>emphasis</em>` marks emphasis,
* `<sc>sc</sc>` marks glossing shortcut, e.g. `1SG`.

Set of additional TeX-like characters may be used:

* `--` is used for creating a dash (`—`),
* `,,` and `''` are used for quote signs,
* `\-` is used for line break,
* `~` is used for non-breaking space.

Feel free to contact me if you have some ideas, new words, loanwords, fixes to
my scripts, to my grammar, if you want to translate The Book or parts of the
dictionary! Issues and Pull Requests are welcome.

  phenomenal [A Grammar of Ayeri](https://github.com/carbeck/ayerigrammar),

* Online HTML dictionary generation is based on the template by PaddiM8 in
  [Sheet2Dictionary](https://github.com/PaddiM8/Sheet2Dictionary) (MIT), but
  was modified to suit this project better.
